# Write a class with a method that takes a number as an input and calculates the sum of its digits, until there is a single digit answer. Include the tests.
# For examples:
# When receiving 16 as a parameter it returns 7 (16 --> 1 + 6)
# When receiving 942 as a parameter it returns 6 (942 --> 9 + 4 + 2 = 15 --> = 1 + 5 = 6)
# When receiving 9999999999 as a parameter it returns 9 (9999999999 --> 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 99 --> = 9 + 9 = 18 --> = 1 + 8 = 9)
